# Project 3: plntify
![plntfy logo](readme-plntify.svg)

## Overview

A plant trading social app. 
The time frame for this group project was a week. Our group was made up of 4 members.
Each user has their own portfolio of plants that is diplayed on their profile page. The users are able to use the interactive map to see other plant's locations as well as add their own. There is a trade feature where users are able to offer a plant from their portfolio in exchange for another user's plant. The user who receives this offer is able to accept or decline. Users are able to like and comment on other user's plants, as well as being able to communicate through a private chat.

## Getting Started

## Brief

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
